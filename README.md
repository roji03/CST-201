# CST-201

Data Structures Lab for S3 KTU Students
This repository contains C code implementations for various data structures covered in the Data Structures Lab course for S3 KTU students. The code is organized into separate folders for each data structure, with each folder containing multiple C files demonstrating different operations and applications of that data structure.

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide S3 KTU students with a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing data structures using C programming language. The code is well-commented and easy to follow, making it an excellent learning aid for students of all level
